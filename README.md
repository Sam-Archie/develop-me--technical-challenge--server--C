This is the API that is currently live at this address:

Here you will be able to see the routes that will allow you to use the API.

More functionality is currently being developed to allow for the viewing of historic games, matches and players scores.
This will also allow for future scalability such as a seeding process ansd the ability to handle Bye's if an odd number of players would like to play.

Look for udates soon!!!
